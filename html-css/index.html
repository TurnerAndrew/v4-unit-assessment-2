                        I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of-

                        I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. What, well you mean like a date? Stop it. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.
                        <br><br>
                        I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. No. No. Ahh. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?
                        <br><br>
                        What did you say? Did you hurt your head? Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Excuse me. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.
                        <br><br>
                        Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Doc, is that a de- Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.
                        <br><br>
                        That's George McFly? Why not? The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. That's George McFly?
                        <br><br>
                        Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. I'll call you tonight. Are you sure about this storm? Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
                        <br><br>
                        Marty, that was very interesting music. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Look, you gotta listen to me. Uh, look me up when you get there. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
                        <br><br>
                        Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. What the hell is this?
                        <br><br>
                        Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Actually, people call me Marty. What's that thing he's on? Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
